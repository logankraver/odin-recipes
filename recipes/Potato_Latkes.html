        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Latkes (potato pancakes) are a must have at Hanukkah, but really are wonderful any time of year! 
            This is my mother's recipe, which is honestly the best latke I've had. I usually end up having to make a second batch because they disappear so quickly. 
            I've tried other recipes and always return to these. Lovely topped with sour cream or applesauce.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups shredded potato</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated onion </li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten </li>
            <li>6 saltine crackers, or as needed, crushed </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>½ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix potato, onion, eggs, crackers, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour enough vegetable oil into a skillet to fill about 1/2-inch deep; heat over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Drop spoonfuls of the potato mixture, first pressing potato mixture against the side of the bowl to remove excess liquid, 
                into the hot oil; slightly flatten the latkes into the oil with the back of your spoon so they are evenly thick.</li>
            <li>Cook in hot oil until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Drain latkes on a plate lined with a paper towel.</li>
        </ol>
